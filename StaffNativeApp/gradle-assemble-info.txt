Checking if the launcher JVM can be re-used for build. To be re-used, the launcher JVM needs to match the parameters required for the build process: --add-opens=java.base/java.util=ALL-UNNAMED --add-opens=java.base/java.lang=ALL-UNNAMED --add-opens=java.base/java.lang.invoke=ALL-UNNAMED --add-opens=java.prefs/java.util.prefs=ALL-UNNAMED --add-opens=java.base/java.nio.charset=ALL-UNNAMED --add-opens=java.base/java.net=ALL-UNNAMED --add-opens=java.base/java.util.concurrent.atomic=ALL-UNNAMED -Xmx4g -Dfile.encoding=UTF-8 -Duser.country=US -Duser.language=en -Duser.variant
To honour the JVM settings for this build a single-use Daemon process will be forked. For more on this, please refer to https://docs.gradle.org/8.2/userguide/gradle_daemon.html#sec:disabling_the_daemon in the Gradle documentation.

An attempt to start the daemon took 1.973 secs.
The client will now receive all logging from the daemon (pid: 15380). The daemon log file: C:\Users\ASUS\.gradle\daemon\8.2\daemon-15380.out.log
Daemon will be stopped at the end of the build
